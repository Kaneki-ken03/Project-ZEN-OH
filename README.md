# About Project ZEN-OH and How To Claim. 
***
ZEN-OH(ZENOH) is a open source and free to claim Commodity representation of value token that we hope will be adopted and used by all.

 *** 
 
Polygon MainNet Token Contract Deployed: 0x51aeaF0EaF0919da5bf5865aC6a0F4D270De060f


***
**No Presale/ICO for ZEN-OH will be held;** we intend to launch an abundant and cheap coin for new users to use in the form of a commodity representation of value token; that may grow in value over time.
***

**ZEN-OH Can Be Claimed in several ways:**

 * once per day by any user at a rate of 100 tokens a day per user; although the total claim amount will be limited to 10,000 total free claims a day.
 
 * once per 7 days by any holder of 1,000,000 tokens or more at a rate of 2,500 Tokens per user.

 * temporarily by any user at a rate of 10 tokens per claim via Promo Claim Function that can be claimed every 20 mins; Promo Token Claims are only available for a limited time and will be discontinued at a future date. we will then reserve the promo claim function for future promo's, giveaways, and offers.

* **once we reach 10,000 users:**
  
* ZEN-OH's current free claim rate will be halved every 3 months till the claim rate becomes 1.5625 ZEN-OH a day; per user.(6 halvings/ Note: future halvings past the 6th and or future discontinuation of free claims are subject to community vote before execution)

the development team will maintain a donations wallet that will be set up to receive donations in the form of ZEN-OH or MATIC.

* **Donation Wallet Address: 0x05932c5B4d79c8b0bFc02Bb3b1309E67Daae8BcD (Only send MATIC or ZEN-OH to this Address.)**


MATIC received from donations will be allotted in a 75%/25% split and the ZEN-OH token donations will be allocated 50%/50%

75% MATIC collected along with 50% of the ZEN-OH tokens will be added to the liquidity pool; while the other 50% of ZEN-OH will be burned once a months.

the remaining 25% MATIC collected from donations will be used to support further project development; this 25% will be subtracted from the total MATIC balance once a month.

the tokens liquidity pool will be listed on UniSwap or similar exchanges.

 
   --Initial supply tokenomics-- 
   
   * initial supply: 420,000,000 ZENOH
   
  * 85% Liquidity Pool (357,000,000 ZENOH)
  
  * 10% Dev Team/Colaborator Tokens (42,000,000 ZENOH)
  
  * 5% Future Rewards/ Distributions/ (21,000,000 ZENOH)

***
**we will burn 100% of LP tokens received from listing on UniSwap.**
this will prevent the initial liquidity that was provided by the development team from ever actually being removed.
(we will update this Page with the transaction hash reffrencing the burn on block explorer here after listing)

* **to protect our users and our project community: we reserve the right to Blacklist wallet addresses that misuse/abuse this projects claim functions; our dedicated security team monitors block explorer on a day to day basis to ensure contract abuse and misuse does not occur. thigs we look for that violate our terms of contract use; holders claim being called by one wallet address and tokens being transferred from the holders wallet to another wallet to call holders claim again; if we notice this behavior the security team will temporarily pause the contract and it will result in an immediate blacklist of the new token holder address by our security team. this will lock the tokens in the blacklisted wallet preventing buying, selling, token transfers to and from the address, as well as preventing the use of any claim features in our contract. from a development standpoint this Pause and Blacklist feature are intended to be failsafe security measures to ensure the project and its users are protected from misuse/abuse. 
 we will note that the one function a blacklisted wallet is allowed to call is the burn function; and we ask that they burn their tokens in the blacklisted wallet via calling the burn function through the smart contract(Function 3)*** *
